# @obvibase/utils

lodash-like utilities.

- Intended for functional-style code, specifically for use with the included pipeline operator polyfill (the `applyPipe` function).

- Due to emphasis on readability of your code, functions in this library only use named parameters as opposed to positional arguments and currying.

- For the same reason, this library prefers to err on the side of smaller API surface and more verbose names.

- Fully tree-shakeable.

- Includes TypeScript type definitions.
