TypeScript/JavaScript utilities for those who don't like utilities. Based on "only one way to do it" principle, this library provides a utility only when something can't be easily and readably accomplished with vanilla JavaScript. The library provides a pipeline operator ponyfill, functions for working with objects, arrays, maps, sets and iterables, memoization utilities, lenses, and more.

Please refer to the [GitHub README](https://github.com/ivan7237d/antiutils) for full documentation.
