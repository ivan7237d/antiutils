# @obvibase/utils

lodash-like utilities.

- Intended for functional-style code, specifically for use with the included pipeline operator polyfill (the `applyPipe` function).

- Due to emphasis on readability, functions in this library only use named parameters (a single object argument) as opposed to positional arguments and currying.

- Function names do not clash with RxJS operators such as `map`.

- Fully tree-shakeable.

- Includes TypeScript type definitions.
