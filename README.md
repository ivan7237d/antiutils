# @obvibase/utils

lodash-like utilities.

- Intended for functional-style code, specifically for use with the included pipeline operator polyfill (the `applyPipe` function).

- Includes functions for working with native `Iterable`s that match equivalent functions for working with observables in RxJS, but are named `mapIterable`, `reduceIterable` etc. to avoid clashes.

- Fully tree-shakeable.

- Includes TypeScript type definitions and designed with an eye to efficient type inference.
